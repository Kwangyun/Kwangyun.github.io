## Outline {#section-0}
The goal of this write-up is to document and demonstrate CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) attacks performed  against the  Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA). The objective of this attack was to change the password of the `admin` account through CSRF attack.This report mocks a penetration testing report and a debriefing situation to a client.

## Vulnerabiltiy Explanation {#section-1}
CSRF is an attack where the attacker causes the victim user to carry out an action unintentionally while that user is authenticated. This can disrupt normal user expereince, data manipulation, deletion, and at times an account takeover. Depending on the account privilege, it could lead to a full control over a application system. CSRF attacks often involve social engineering techniques such as tricking the user to click on a malicious link. There are several prerequisites for an CSRF attack to be successful. The user has to be already logged into the application using cookie based sessions without proper CSRF defence in place. The user has to be tricked to conduct some action such as clicking on a malicious link.

## Proof of Concept {#section-2}
For proof of concept (POC), the tester has simulated a phishing attack to conduct a CSRF attack. In the email, the tester has impersonated a prosecutor to entice the victim to click on the link.  Upon clicking on the link, the authenticated DVWA victim user is redirected to a malicious website that looks like a real prosecution service hompage. Here the victim's password is changed unintentionally to without notice. The victim user `admin` whos original password was `admin` cannot login with this password anymore because it has been unintentionally changed by simply visiting the website. The simulation can be seen below.

In the `Security-Low-Level` module, the testers figured out that the website had significant vulnerabilities when the `change password` request was intercepted. These vulnerabilities included the usage of the `GET` method, reliance on cookie-based sessions, and most importantly, the absence of any CSRF token implementation. Specifically, the use of the `GET` method exposes the transmitted data in the URL, which allowed the tester to view sensitive information and manipulate it.

For example, in the interception of `/vulnerabilities/csrf/?password_new=admin&password_conf=admin&Change=Change`, the password change request's sensitive data, such as the new password, was clearly visible in the URL. This exposed various avenues for the tester such as embedding this password change request in a malicous website as seen above. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to use the more secure `POST` method when submitting sensitive data.

Furthermore, despite the website utilizing cookies for session management, it lacked proper prevention mechanisms like CSRF tokens to validate and block unauthorized changes. This omission allowed the tester to manipulate requests on behalf of the users when they visited the website.

In the  `Security-Medium-Level` module the tester figured out that the website was using a `Referer` to check the origin of the request. That is, if the request was not made from the origin, the tester would not be able to make any changes to the account. This can be seen in burpe suite, where there is a new `Referer` section in the header.

Moreover, analzying the source code, it can be seen that the php code checks if the `referer` contains the servername. `  if( stripos( $_SERVER[ 'HTTP_REFERER' ] ,$_SERVER[ 'SERVER_NAME' ]) !== false )`

However, this prevention method bypassable, as the tester could simply add the sever name to the malicious url to bypass this defense method.


In the  `Security-High-Level` module there are CSRF token measures and Cross origin request block, same origin Policy (SOP). This prevents java scriopt code from making a cross origin request. This can only be 
### Hosting a Malicious Website
Firstly the tester  crafted a html that could condcut the CSRF attack. The base html was made mainly through the use of iframe to embed a real websit, in this case the Korean Prosecuetion service webpage. Moreover, the tester used the img source html tag to conduct the malicous action of changing the password. Finally The tester hosted a python server to host this website. The code snipet can be seen below 

The tester was able to craft a simple phising email that impersonated a prosecutor with the help of ChatGPT. The tester made sure that the email consisted of a sense of urgency, time pressure, threats of legal action and a sense of authority in the email. In crafting the email, the tester first modified the sender's name to Prosecution Service. This could be done by logging into gmail, navigating to `Accounts and Imports` and changing the `Send Mail as`. Next upon crafting the email, the tester utilized the gmail link function to hide the orginal hosted webpage to a simplge clickable `Link`
 

However, there are alot of space for improvement for this simulated attack. For instance, the email could have been improved if the sending email address was hidden or if the tester utilized a seemigly more realistic email address. Moreover, making the link URL less suspicious is another task that needs further study.


### Common flaws in CSRF token validation
1. Change the request method from from `POST` to `GET` to bypass validation
2. Removing the entire parameter containing the token to bypass validationtion.
3. CSRF token is not tied to the user session. The attacker can log in to the application using their own account, obtain a valid token
