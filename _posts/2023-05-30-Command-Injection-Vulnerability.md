## Outline {#section-0}
The goal of this write-up is to document and demonstrate various OS command injection attacks performed  against the  Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) input field. The objective of this attack was to gain unathorized access to the system as `www-data` service user.  This was conducted as an individual study project hosted by [Grootboan Security](https://security.grootboan.com/). Theis report mocks a penetration testing report and a debriefing situation to a client with follow up questions. 

## Vulnerabiltiy Explanation {#section-1}
A command injection vulnerability is a security flaw in a system that allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the host's operating system. This is a serious security flaw
as it allows attackers to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges of the application or user. If the application/user has high privilege this could extend beyond the host system and impact the entire network or infrastructure.


## Proof of Concept {#section-2}
For POC, in the security-low level ,the testers has figured that the input field is vulnerable to command injection. When providing an ip address augmented with the `&&` operator and `/etc/passwd` the testing team was able view sensetive data of the system. The `&&` operator signifies the first command to execute 

To take steps further the testing team has made use of  socat to to create a TCP connection back to the testers machine to establish a revershell.  First the testing team created a socat listener and gave socat.  This gives the attackers a full interactive shell, providing the abiltiy to freely browse the system, potentially privilege escalate and latterally move within the internal network.
