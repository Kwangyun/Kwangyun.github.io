Brute forcing DVWA login page

## Outline

The goal of this write-up is to document a brute force attack performed against the login system of DVWA(Dam Vulernable Web Application). The objective of this attack was to gain unauthorized admin access by brute forcing password against the 'admin' account. This was conducted as a group-study project for Groot Security. \
The writ-up discuess the following content:

## Vulnerabiltiy Explanation
A brute force attack is systematically trying out all possible combinations of password or username into a system until  valid credentials are found.
The purpose of a brute force attack is to gain unauthorized access into a system. This could not only lead to loss of sensetive data but also privilege escalation
for the attacker. If the breached credentials has admin level access, this could signify an entire take over of a system.

The DVWA /vulnerabilities/brute URL is vulnerable to user authentication brute force attack, as it does not have security measures in place.

We were able to sucessfully attain the password for the 'admin' account and gain access to the 'Protected Admin Area' using Hydra as our main tool for brute forcing.
